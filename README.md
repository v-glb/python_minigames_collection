# Python Minigame Collection

## Intro

Welcome to my collection of various minigames written in Python. This project
was just for fun and marked my first steps of getting to know Python. =)

All games are accessible via a simple menu that lets you choose your desired game.

## Games

### Roll the dice

Set the number of the dice, e.g. D6, D10, D20 or something completely different
and see which number you get.

### Guess the number

Try to guess a random number between 0 and a number of your choice. Gives hints
if your guess is lower or higher than the random number.

### Hangman

Try to guess a random word from a dictionary within 10 tries. Two languages
are currently supported:

- english
- german

## How to use it

After cloning the repository you need to run `main.py`. If you get any errors,
check if Python3 is installed.
Have fun!
